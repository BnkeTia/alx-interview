# 0x0A. Prime Game
#### `Algorithm` `Python`

For this project, you will need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

## Concepts Needed:
#### 1. Prime Numbers:

* Understanding what prime numbers are.
* Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.
#### 2. Sieve of Eratosthenes:

* An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.
#### 3. Game Theory:

* Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
* Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.
#### 4. Dynamic Programming/Memoization:

* Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.
#### 5. Python Programming:

* Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
* Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
