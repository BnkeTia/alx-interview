# 0x01. Lockboxes
### `Algorithm` `Python`

# Must Know
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

## Concepts Needed:
### Lists and List Manipulation:

* Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
* [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/TtGNy9p1p1d0O5G1rdY1Aw)
### Graph Theory Basics:

* Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
* [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/eVcYI8g-6nF0Na46xnRdhw)
### Algorithmic Complexity:

* Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
* [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/01qym1qAJUkLrb47PvqnKg)
### Recursion:

* Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
* [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/zpEuvv0l9EHohIx-HwiAAA)
### Queue and Stack:

* Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
* [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/CQLm4RJrdwyo2DAcNCtwIA)
### Set Operations:

* Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
* [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/zkmtaPqAbKyxx41kRw7ulA)
By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.
